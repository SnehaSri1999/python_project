# üß† Kidney Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project involves analyzing clinical data and implementing supervised machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the presence of **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## üìà Models & Results

| Model               | Accuracy   |
|--------------------|------------|
| Logistic Regression | 98.86%     |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 98.86%     |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN - k=22) | 98.86%     |

> All models performed remarkably well, highlighting the strength of clinical indicators in CKD prediction.
